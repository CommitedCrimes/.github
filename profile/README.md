# Commited Crimes

Welcome to the Commited Crimes organization! Our mission is simple: to create a bunch of fun projects and tools, just for the sake of building things. Our commit habits are so questionable, it should be a crime itself‚Äîbut rest assured, it's all in good fun!

## What We Do

- We build tools for everyone, and also no-one.
- We embrace creativity, experimentation, and a bit of chaos in our development process.
- Our projects are meant to be enjoyable, sometimes useful, and always open to contribution.

## Why "Commited Crimes"?

We chose the name because our commit practices are hilariously bad‚Äîso much so, it feels criminal. But that's part of the fun! We don't take ourselves too seriously, and we encourage others to do the same.

## Goals

- Develop and share quirky, interesting projects.
- Foster an open, welcoming community for all kinds of developers.
- Never let perfectionism get in the way of shipping something cool.

**P.S.** We never create anything intended for actual crime. All our projects are strictly for fun and learning!
