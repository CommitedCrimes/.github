# ☕ UserBrew

**Brewed tools for modern developers.**  
We create open-source software that’s minimal, secure, and built for sharing — with just the right amount of flavor.

## 🍺 What We Do

UserBrew is a tech-driven organization crafting developer tools and services that focus on:

- 🧠 **Brevity-first design** — Simple tools that do one thing well  
- 🔐 **Secure authentication** — Auth solutions with modern best practices (OAuth, JWT, BetterAuth, etc.)  
- ⚙️ **Composable stacks** — Built with Go, and React  
- 🧪 **Open source by default** — Every project lives and grows in public (eventually)
